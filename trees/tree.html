            <h3>Interpretation</h3>

            <p>A Tree ADT can be represented in two ways</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tree Data structure(in practice, this is the most ,most common implementation)</li>
                <li>Array Data structure</li>
                <li>... I have no idea how many else are there !!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whenever we do not specify exactly what a Tree is, and just refer to it as a "Tree", we mean the Tree
                Data
                structure representation of the Tree ADT. Also in practice, most(but not all) Tree ADT are implemented
                using the Tree Data structure. Hence they essentially mean the same, but it is important to keep the
                above
                points mind before we proceed further.

            <h3>Tree as Abstract Data Type</h3>

            <p> A Tree Abstract Data Type is a collection of elements, with one of them being designated as the root and
                hierarchically related to collection sub elements, which themselves are trees. Collection here means any
                number of elements, be it 0 element(s), 1 element(s) or any number of positive elements.
            </p>


            <p> The collection of sub elements referred above are sub trees, and the roots of those sub trees are
                referred to as the children of the root. In general, any element in a tree is referred to as a node, and
                the roots of sub trees hierarchically related to this node are referred to as children of the node.
                Convenient definition is based on hierarchical relation i.e nodes, one level below in the hierarchy are
                referred to as children, conversely, the node immediately one level up the hierarchy is called the
                parent node.
            </p>

            <p>
                The property of tree prohibits the node from having two parents, forming cycles in the hierarchy and
                enforces uni-directionality in the hierarchy enforcement.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a generic definition of tree, before we proceed to specific trees as lot of literature does not
                distinguish between a tree and binary tree and co.
            </p>

            <p>Consider an example</p>

            <img src="http://placehold.it/500x300&text=Figure:TreeExample1" alt="Tree Example 1"/>

            <p>Consider some more examples which are trees</p>
            <img src="http://placehold.it/500x300&text=Figure:TreeExample2" alt="Tree Example 2"/>
            <img src="http://placehold.it/500x300&text=Figure:TreeExample3" alt="Tree Example 3"/>

            <p>Consider examples which are not trees</p>
            <img src="http://placehold.it/500x300&text=Figure:TreeExample4" alt="Tree Example 4"/>
            <img src="http://placehold.it/500x300&text=Figure:TreeExample5" alt="Tree Example 5"/>

            <p>In our examples so far we have seen that all elements are distinct, but for now, we assume that all
                elements in a tree are distinct. The techniques multiple copies of an element is deferred for a
                while</p>

            <p>Also, we see that a Tree is specific case of a Undirected Graph in which any two vertices are connected
                by only one path.</p>

            <p>As mentioned earlier, the Tree ADT can be represented in two ways, Tree Data structure, Array Data
                structure.</p>
